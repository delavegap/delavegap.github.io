A Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model is used to analyze the effects of the massive Venezuelan immigration in Colombia in recent years. Through simulations, different scenarios associated with the migratory shock are compared, including policy interventions and international aid. It is found that, despite the fall in real wages and the increase in unemployment, migration tends to increase levels of income, activity and welfare. These results are consistent with previous evidence and allow obtaining basic insights and orders of magnitude of the effects.
