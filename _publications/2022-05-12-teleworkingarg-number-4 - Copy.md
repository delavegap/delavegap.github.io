We estimate the role of teleworking as a mitigator of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic shock on the Argentine labor market. To that aim we analyze the link between occupational-level teleworking potential scores, estimated from three different surveys (ONET, PIAAC, and STEP), and labor market outcomes at the individual level, exploiting the rotating panel structure of the Argentine national household survey. We find that during the peak of  pandemic-related restrictions, the potential for teleworking was positively correlated with the probability of being active and employed. These effects are concentrated in the subsample of “non-essential” workers. In contrast, we find no systematic effects of teleworking potential on employment transitions prior to the pandemic, a reassuring result consistent with our identification strategy.
